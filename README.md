# Udacity Memory Game Project
The game board is made up of 16 tiles randomly arranged in a grid.  They rearrange every time the game is reset or the page is reloaded.

## How to Play
1. The player flips over one tile to reveal it's letter
2. The player then flips over another tile to reveal it's letter
3. If the tiles match, the tiles remain flipped over
4. If the tiles do not match they flip back over
5. The game ends once all matching tiles have been revealed
